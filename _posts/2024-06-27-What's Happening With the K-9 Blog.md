As we continue our journey of transitioning K-9 Mail to Thunderbird for Android, we are officially sunsetting the K-9 Mail blog. But, this isn’t goodbye – just a change in scenery! Moving forward, all updates, news, and exciting developments will be shared regularly on the [Thunderbird Blog](https://blog.thunderbird.net/).

If you’ve missed the most [recent update](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/07/thunderbird-for-android-k-9-mail-june-2024-progress-report/) on the Thunderbird blog ([or any of the previous monthly updates](https://blog.thunderbird.net/category/mobile-news/)), there has been a lot of momentum and progress! In the last nine months, we informed our community know that we have:

- updated K-9 to Material 3
- made K-9 compatible with Android 14
- added longtime Thunderbird contributor Philipp Kewisch as the manager for Thunderbird on mobile
- [fixed a lot of bugs](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/labels/type%3A%20bug)!

We know more improvements will follow, and we will continue to update you all on the Thunderbird blog on a monthly basis. And for all of you who are fans of our little robot dog, the K-9 app and all its associated branding will be maintained alongside Thunderbird for the foreseeable future.

Thank you to all of our users, contributors, and supporters who have helped make K-9 into a great email app with equally great values: privacy, open standards, and open development. This regeneration is only the start of K-9’s next adventure!
